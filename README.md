# Final-Project
# Overview

For the backend application for this final project, I decided to use Node.js/Express.Js and connected it to the Postgres Database. I initially created two models for this api. A model for "appointments" as well as a model for "users". Then have them connect with a one to many relationship. That way a user can create as many appointments as he/she would like.
